# SVG-Generator

## Description
A CLI app that takes in user information via the inquirer package and generates an SVG logo based on the user's answers. The user is asked what three characters they'd like to use for their logo and is given the opportunity to enter a color keyword or hex code for the text color. They are then shown a choice between a circle, a square, and a triangle for the background shape of their logo. Finally the user is asked to provide a color for their shape, either by color keyword or hex code. An SVG file is then generated using the answers to their questions. At least that's how it should work. Mine doesn't and I can't figure out why and haven't been able to get the help needed.

## Installation
Download the code from GitHub, open the package.json file in the terminal, run 'npm install' to install the packages, and finally enter 'node index.js' in the terminal to initialize the application.

## Usage
Follow the prompts in the terminal to answer the questions and then check VS Code for your logo.svg file after completion.

## Issues
Oh boy does this application have some issues. First of all it doesn't work at all. As show in the video running 'node index.js' in the terminal returns an error. I also tried running 'node prompts.js' in the terminal and that also returned an error. Even without those errors, I can't figure out how to get the logo.svg file to generate. Some major work is needed to get this application functional.
